// Package mcphint builds the annotation block an MCP tool advertises about
// itself: a human-readable title, and the hints a client uses to decide what it
// may run without asking.
//
// The hints are stated once here, as four shapes, rather than written out at
// every tool. Fifty-three tools spread over two servers is where "readOnlyHint
// on the read tools" stops being a rule and starts being fifty-three chances to
// disagree with itself — and a client that auto-approves on a hint is trusting
// the least careful of them.

// The protocol takes two of these hints as pointers, and every annotation
// block gets its own copy rather than sharing one: a package-level `false`
// whose address is handed to fifty-three tools is one stray assignment away
// from re-labelling all of them at once.

// closedWorld says the tool's domain of interaction is closed. These tools act
// on the account's own workspaces, tasks and memories: none reaches a search
// engine, a third-party API or anything else whose answer this server cannot
// predict. The protocol's default is the opposite, so it is worth saying.

//
// DestructiveHint and IdempotentHint are left out on purpose: the protocol says
// both are meaningful only when ReadOnlyHint is false, and a hint that carries
// no meaning still has to be read by somebody.
