-- Backfill task latency (postgres): one task_latencies row per task whose
-- history ends closed (completed/rejected), then the hourly, daily and monthly
-- rollups over every complete hour/day, and the claims that tell the stats API
-- the rollups are there. Safe to re-run: task rows written by the server are
-- kept; rollup rows are recomputed from task_latencies.

-- 1. One row per closed task, from its whole history — the arithmetic of
