/**
 * Server-sent events client for the main process.
 *
 * The renderer already consumes this stream through `useEventBus.js` for live
 * UI updates. The main process needs its own connection for a different reason:
 * notifications have to keep arriving when the window is in the background, and
 * on some platforms a backgrounded renderer is throttled. This client is
 * deliberately separate from the renderer's and does not replace it.
 *
 * Reconnect behaviour matches `useEventBus.js` exactly — one second, doubling to
 * a thirty second ceiling, and a hard stop on 401 rather than a reconnect loop
 * against a server that has already said no.
 *
 * Everything is injected, so the parsing and backoff rules are testable in plain
 * Node with no Electron and no network.

 * How long the stream may deliver nothing at all before it is treated as dead.
 *
 * The reconnect loop below only runs when a read ends or throws, and a stream
 * can do neither: when Chromium's network service crashes it abandons the
 * response rather than failing it, so `reader.read()` waits forever and the
 * backoff underneath is never reached. Notifications stop for the life of the
 * process and nothing anywhere says why.
 *
 * Silence is a sound test here because the backend never goes quiet — it
 * flushes a `: agentrq` keepalive comment every thirty seconds
 * (backend/internal/app/app.go). This is 2.5 of those, so a slow round trip or
 * one missed tick is not mistaken for a dead connection.
