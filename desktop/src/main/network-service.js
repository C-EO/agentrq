 * Noticing that Chromium's network service has died.

 * It is a separate utility process, and when it goes every request that was in
 * flight is abandoned rather than failed — no rejection, no error event, just
 * silence. Electron restarts the service, so the app keeps working for anything
 * started afterwards, and that is what makes this worth handling explicitly:
 * the symptom is not a crash but a connection that is dead and still looks
 * open. The main process's event stream is the one thing that holds such a
 * connection for the life of the app, so it is what has to be told.
 *
 * Everything below is a plain function over the details Electron passes, so it
 * is testable without an Electron binary.
