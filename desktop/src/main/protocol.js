/**
 * The app:// protocol handler — the piece that makes the desktop app work at all.
 *
 * The web frontend addresses the API with same-origin *relative* URLs
 * (`src/api.js`) and authenticates with the `at` cookie. A renderer loaded from
 * file:// would make every one of those calls cross-origin, and the backend
 * sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` without `Allow-Credentials`, so the
 * cookie would never be attached.
 *
 * So the renderer is served from a privileged `app://` scheme and everything
 * under /api, /mcp and /.well-known is forwarded to the configured AgentRQ
 * server from the main process. The forward runs through Electron's `net`
 * module, which uses the session cookie jar, so `Set-Cookie` from a login is
 * stored against the real server host and replayed on later calls. The renderer
 * only ever sees same-origin traffic, and the backend needs no CORS change.
 *
 * Everything here takes its Electron and filesystem dependencies as arguments so
 * the routing rules can be tested in plain Node with no Electron binary.

 * connect-src — API traffic needs nothing beyond 'self' because it is proxied
 * through this same origin.
 *
 * img-src carries the sign-in providers' avatar CDNs. `user.picture` is the URL
 * the provider hands back verbatim, pointing at their own host, so 'self' alone
 * silently blocked every profile photo and the sidebar fell back to the
 * initial-letter placeholder — visible only in the desktop build, because the
 * browser build is served without a CSP at all.
 *
 * These are listed host by host rather than opening img-src to `https:`. The
 * point of the policy is that injected markup cannot reach an arbitrary origin,
 * and an <img> to a URL of the attacker's choosing is a working beacon even
 * though it renders nothing.
 *
 * Deliberately absent: COOP/COEP. Cross-origin isolation would unlock
 * multi-threaded WASM, but `require-corp` also blocks every CDN response that
 * lacks a CORP header, including the model weights. Single-threaded inference
 * works; isolation can be revisited if transcription proves too slow.
 *
 * In dev the Vite client needs inline and eval'd script, so the policy is
 * relaxed there and there only.
 *
 * `serverUrl` is here for the terminal socket, and for nothing else — see
 * [webSocketOrigin]. It is why this is rebuilt per request rather than once:
 * the configured server changes when somebody switches profile or answers the
 * connection screen, and a policy baked in at startup would still name the
