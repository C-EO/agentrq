/**
 * Where a link should open.
 *
 * A link out of the app goes to the user's real browser. That is where their
 * extensions, their bookmarks, their other tabs and their existing sessions are,
 * and a second Chromium with none of them is not a browser anyone asked for.
 *
 * The one exception is signing in to AgentRQ, and it is not a preference: the
 * `at` cookie has to land in *this* profile's jar for the app to become
 * authenticated. Handed to the system browser, the sign-in would succeed
 * somewhere the app cannot read, and the app would still be signed out.
 *
 * So this is a classification rather than a boolean:
 *
 * - `app://` is the application; the router already handles those in place.
 * - An AgentRQ auth URL is the sign-in flow, and stays in the app.
 * - Everything else on http(s) is the web, and belongs in the browser.
 * - `mailto:`, `tel:` and their siblings address a program that is not a
 *   browser, and go to the OS the same way.
 * - `javascript:`, `data:` and `file:` are never opened from a link at all.
 *   Handing any of those to `shell.openExternal` is the well-worn way for
 *   injected markup in a message body to reach the machine it is running on.
 *
 * Kept apart from index.js because that module needs a live Electron to import,
 * and this decision is the part worth testing.
