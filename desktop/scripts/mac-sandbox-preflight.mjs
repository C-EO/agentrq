/**
 * Why `npm run dev` prints this on macOS, and what to do about it:
 *
 *   sandbox_extension_issue_file failed for .../Electron Helper.app/.../Resources: 1
 *
 * Chromium's helper processes run in the OS sandbox, so the browser process
 * asks macOS for a read extension covering the helper's own Resources
 * directory. That line is macOS refusing — it is printed by libsandbox, not by
 * Chromium, which logs nothing here and simply carries on with a null token
 * (sandbox/mac/seatbelt_extension.cc). So it is a message about the machine,
 * not about this app, and it is dev-only: a packaged build ships a signed
 * bundle in a normal location and never asks for the extension this way.
 *
 * It is still worth catching, because the two causes that are actually ours to
 * fix look identical from the log: a quarantined or a damaged copy of the
 * unpackaged Electron under node_modules. macOS attaches
 * `com.apple.quarantine` to downloaded archives, and Electron's is downloaded
 * on install — recent macOS releases have been increasingly willing to refuse
 * things inside such a bundle, up to deleting it outright.
 *
 * This runs before Electron starts and says which it is. It never blocks the
 * launch: the message is usually harmless, and a preflight that stopped dev on
 * a harmless warning would be worse than the warning.
