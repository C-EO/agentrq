// the instant that terminal closes, before any shutdown code runs — so every
// agent on the machine is orphaned, which is the single outcome the shutdown
// path exists to prevent.
//
// Unless it is already ignored, which is what `nohup` does precisely so the
// daemon *does* survive the terminal closing. signal.Notify would quietly
// replace that with a handler and turn nohup into the opposite of what it
// means, so an inherited SIG_IGN is left alone.
