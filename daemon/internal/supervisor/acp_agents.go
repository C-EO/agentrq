// ListAcpModels asks the gateway what one agent supports.
//
// Unlike --list-agents, --list-models opens a real agent session and so
// needs a workspace: the gateway loads .mcp.json from dir before it ever gets
// to the agent, and refuses without one — confirmed against a real run, which
// otherwise fails with "Could not find .mcp.json" before printing anything
// this could parse. dir is therefore the workspace's own working directory on
// this machine, the same one a launch would use, not a scratch directory —
// its *content* does not matter to this call (the gateway opens the listing
// session with no MCP servers attached), only that a real .mcp.json is
// findable there. A workspace that has never been launched from has none yet,
// which is why this is a lookup behind a free-text field and not a gate: an
// empty dir, or one with no config, means an empty list, exactly like any
// other failure here.
//
// agent reaches an argv exactly as the launch path's own --agent does, so it
// is checked the same way before os/exec sees it — refusing anything that is
// not a plain identifier is what stops a value being read as a flag by the
// process being run.
