/**
 * The what-to-run control, and the one thing about it that is not obvious.
 *
 * jsdom has no layout, so the width this is really about cannot be measured
 * here. What can be pinned down is the pair of classes that produce it: an
 * `inline-flex` is as wide as its widest option demands, and without
 * `max-w-full` on the group and `min-w-0` on the options it cannot be made
 * narrower than that. In the workspace panel's 420px card the demand exceeded
 * the column, so the control spilled through the card's right padding and the
 * modal looked lopsided.
 *
 * Both launch forms — the machine page's and the workspace panel's — render
 * this same component, so losing either class breaks both at once. Hence a
 * test of the component rather than of one of its two callers.
