/**
 * Offering to start a task on a clean context.
 *
 * When a task carries this, the backend types `/clear` into the agent's
 * terminal before it hands the task over, so the agent reads it without the
 * previous task still in its context.
 *
 * ## Why the option is hidden rather than disabled
 *
 * It depends on something the workspace either has or has not: a **running
 * Claude Code session**, on a machine whose daemon is connected. A workspace
 * with no machine has no terminal to type into, and the backend ignores the
 * flag — correctly, because a task must never be withheld from an agent over a
 * convenience. A control that is always shown and silently does nothing half
 * the time is worse than one that appears when it can work.
 *
 * ## Why the kind is checked here, unlike `useWorkspaceTerminal`
 *
 * `isWatchable` there deliberately does *not* check the kind: anything in a
 * pseudo-terminal is worth watching, because a process asks its own questions
 * on the way up whatever it is.
 *
 * This is the opposite case and the opposite answer. `/clear` is a Claude Code
 * command, and it is being *typed* rather than read — offered for a gateway
 * session it would put six stray characters into whatever that agent was
 * doing. Watching is safe for any kind; typing is not.
