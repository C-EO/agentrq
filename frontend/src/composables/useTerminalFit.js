/**
 * When a terminal is sized to its box, and what to do when it cannot be.
 *
 * This is here rather than in `SessionTerminal.vue` because it is a policy with
 * three rules that fight each other, and all three have a bug behind them. A
 * component is where it was, and where none of them could be tested.
 *
 * ## A fit that did not happen looks exactly like one that did
 *
 * `FitAddon.fit()` returns nothing and throws nothing. Read its source: it asks
 * `proposeDimensions()` first, and that answers `undefined` whenever the
 * renderer has not measured a character cell yet —
 * `dimensions.css.cell.width === 0`. `fit()` then returns having done nothing
 * at all, and a caller that reads `term.cols` back gets **80×24**, xterm's
 * default, with no way to know it is not a measurement.
 *
 * So a fit is *attempted*, the attempt can fail, and a failed attempt is
 * retried on the next frame rather than recorded as a size.
 *
 * **How far that is actually established.** The no-op path is real and is
 * quoted from the addon's source. What is *not* established is that it happens
 * here: measured in headless Chromium against this app's own
 * `TERMINAL_OPTIONS`, `proposeDimensions()` answered a real size synchronously,
 * in the same tick as `open()`, on every attempt. So treat this file as a
 * guard against a documented hazard, not as the proven cure for a reported
 * symptom. If you are here because terminals are still mis-shaped on first
 * open, this is probably not where the cause lives — look for a
 * wrong-but-plausible measurement, which every guard in here would let past.
 *
 * ## Nothing else was going to retry
 *
 * The only other thing that fits is the resize observer, and an observer fires
 * when the box *changes*. A box mis-measured once and then left alone never
 * changes, so a bad measurement would survive until somebody resized something
 * by hand.
 *
 * Retries are bounded all the same. A terminal in a panel nobody has opened
 * measures zero every frame, and spinning a render-frame loop forever to
 * discover that is worse than waiting: when it is shown, the observer fires.
 *
 * ## It must never fit to a box that depends on its own height
 *
 * Two rules from the growing-terminal bug, and both are kept here rather than
 * relaxed — see the note in `docs/agents/machines-and-daemon.md`:
 *
 * - **A measurement that has not changed is not acted on.** Fitting makes the
 *   terminal taller, which is a box change, which fits again. The comparison
 *   is what breaks that loop, so `onSize` is called for a size that is new and
 *   never merely for a fit that ran.
 * - **A box too small to mean anything is not fitted to.** Fitting to zero
 *   throws away the dimensions the terminal needs for when it comes back.
 *   Unlike the loop guard, this one *is* transient, so it counts as a failed
 *   attempt and is retried.
 */

/**
 * How many frames a fit is retried for before waiting for the observer.
 *
 * Twenty is about a third of a second at 60Hz, which is far longer than a
 * renderer takes to measure a cell and still short enough that a hidden
 * terminal stops asking. It is not a timeout anybody waits on: the resize
 * observer picks up anything slower.

/**
 * Re-fit once the terminal's webfont is really there.
 *
 * xterm measures a character cell when the terminal opens. Before this repo
 * shipped a font that measurement was safe, because whatever the stack resolved
 * to was already installed — the cell it measured was the cell it would keep.
 * A webfont breaks that: the first measurement is of the *fallback*, the real
 * face arrives a moment later, and from then on every glyph is a different
 * width from the cell it is drawn into. Nothing re-measures on its own, so the
 * terminal stays that shape until somebody resizes something.
 *
 * ## `document.fonts.ready` alone is the wrong answer
 *
 * It reads like the whole fix and it is not, because **a font nothing has asked
 * for is not loading, and `ready` does not wait for it.** A face is only
 * fetched when a glyph needs it, so `ready` read in the same tick as `open()`
 * can resolve against whatever else was in flight — the UI font, say — and say
 * nothing about the terminal's. That version passes review and re-fits at the
 * wrong moment.
 *
 * So each face is `load()`ed first, which is what starts the request, and only
 * then is `ready` awaited. Measured: with `ready` alone the webfont had not
 * been applied by the time the terminal was measured.
 *
 * A face that fails to load is *not* a reason to skip the re-fit — the cell
 * then still holds the fallback that was measured at open, and `useTerminalFit`
 * drops a size that has not changed anyway.
 *
 * ## ...and re-fitting on its own changes nothing
 *
 * The second half, and the one that looks like it should not be needed: the fit
 * addon divides the host box by the cell xterm **cached when it opened**, so a
 * fit after the font lands returns the columns it already had. `remeasure` is
 * what makes the terminal measure the cell again, and without it this whole
 * file is an elaborate no-op. See `remeasureCell` in `useTerminalView`, which
 * is what the component passes and where the awkward part lives.
 *
 * @param {object} deps
 * @param {FontFaceSet} deps.fonts `document.fonts`, or nothing where there is
 *        no font loading API — jsdom, so the caller needs no guard of its own.
 * @param {string[]} deps.specs CSS font shorthands, one per face to wait for.
 * @param {() => void} deps.refit `useTerminalFit`'s `request`.
 * @param {() => void} [deps.remeasure] makes xterm measure a cell again, before
 *        the fit that reads it.
 * @returns {{cancel: () => void, done: Promise<boolean>}} `cancel` for unmount;
 *        `done` resolves to whether a re-fit was asked for, which is what a
 *        test can wait on.
