/**
 * Messages written while the agent is mid-turn, held in the browser.
 *
 * The ACP gateway gives a session one turn at a time and chains a second
 * delivery behind the first, so a message posted mid-turn does not reach the
 * agent — it waits in the gateway, unseen and unrecallable. The composer used
 * to answer that by refusing input altogether. This is the other answer: take
 * the message, keep it here, and send nothing until the turn ends.
 *
 * Which is what makes it editable. Nothing has left the browser, so changing
 * your mind is a local edit rather than a retraction — the thing the old
 * locked composer could not offer.
 *
 * Two rules the tests exist to hold:
 *
 * - **A queued message belongs to the task it was written in.** The task view
 *   is reused across tasks, so the queue is keyed by task and a send is
 *   addressed to the task the queue was loaded for, never to whatever is on
 *   screen when it fires. `usePendingSend` learned this the hard way.
 * - **They leave one at a time, one per turn.** The head goes when a turn ends
 *   and starts a turn of its own; the rest wait for that one to end. Which is
 *   what keeps them editable — a message only stops being yours to change at
 *   the moment it is actually its turn to go.
