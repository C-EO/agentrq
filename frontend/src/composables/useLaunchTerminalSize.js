/**
 * The terminal size a launch sends, worked out from the box it will actually
 * render into.
 *
 * Both launch panels — the machine page's form and the workspace's own —
 * navigate to `/sessions/<id>` the moment the daemon has been asked, and the
 * daemon creates the pty at the size in that request, before anything has
 * attached to resize it. Sending a hardcoded size here is what makes an
 * agent's first screen wrap wrong on a small window and waste the rest of a
 * large one; the fix is not a better constant, because no single constant is
 * right for both.
 *
 * `App.vue` never unmounts the element `CONTENT_AREA_SELECTOR` marks — Vue
 * Router swaps the routed page underneath it — so its size while a launch
 * panel is open is the size the terminal page is about to get. Only the
 * terminal page's own chrome on top of that (its heading row, the terminal
 * card's header bar, border and padding) has to be estimated, because that
 * page is not mounted yet to measure.
