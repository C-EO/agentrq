 *
 * This is the wiring: it builds the catalogue in `src/webmcp/tools.js` with the
 * live API client and router, hands it to the browser, and withdraws it again
 * when the session ends. The two halves it joins are deliberately framework-free
 * — this file is the only part that knows about Vue.
 *
 * Registration is tied to being signed in, and that is a security property
 * rather than tidiness. Every tool acts as the signed-in user, with the same
 * cookie and therefore exactly the same permissions the interface itself has:
 * no more, and none at all once they log out. Withdrawing the tools on sign-out
 * is what keeps that true, because the page is not reloaded in between.
