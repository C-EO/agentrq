/**
 * What an event on the live stream is worth saying out loud, in the browser.
 *
 * A pure decision, separate from the component that shows it, because the
 * component is not in the coverage include list and this is the part with rules
 * in it. The desktop app makes the same decision in
 * `desktop/src/main/notifications.js`; the two differ in what they can show —
 * a toast here, a system notification there — not in what counts as news.
 *
 * ## Why the sender decides, and not the event type
 *
 * `reply.received` is published for **every** new message on a task, whoever
 * wrote it: the central forwarder maps a message create to it without looking
 * at who. So the type alone cannot tell "the agent answered" from "I just sent
 * that". The payload carries the messages, so the last one's `sender` can, and
 * does.
 *
 * That is also the whole of the bug this file was written for. The old branch
 * notified for a permission request and for the agent's own "Status updated
 * to:" text, and had no case at all for an agent simply replying — which is
 * the commonest thing that happens.
