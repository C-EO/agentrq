/**
 * Whether the agent is in the middle of a turn, and what the composer should
 * do about it.
 *
 * The ACP gateway gives a task one session and a session one turn at a time, so
 * a second message delivered while a turn is running is chained behind it
 * rather than reaching the agent — `runTurnForTask` in the gateway is where
 * that happens, and its comment says exactly why: two prompts on one session
 * are refused or interleave. Someone who types "no, stop, do the other thing"
 * has therefore not stopped anything; they have added to the list of things it
 * will do afterwards.
 *
 * So the composer offers the stop as well as the send, and what the send does
 * changes: mid-turn it holds the message in the browser rather than posting
 * it. Nothing reaches the gateway until the turn ends, which is what makes a
 * queued message editable — see `useQueuedMessages`.
 *
 * ## Why this is derived rather than reported
 *
 * Nothing on the server knows it. What the server tracks is whether a
 * stop-capable agent is *attached*, which is a different question — and
 * `ongoing` is true for the whole life of a task, including every moment the
 * agent is waiting on a reply from the human. Swapping on either would replace
 * Send with Stop permanently and make the task unanswerable, which is worse
 * than the bug.
 *
 * ## What ends a turn
 *
 * Not a reply. The gateway's own instructions tell agents to report progress
 * with `reply` every few steps, so a reply arriving is usually the agent
 * talking *while* it works. Reading one as the end of a turn is what would
 * quietly hand the composer back mid-turn and queue the next message — the bug
 * this exists to fix.
 *
 * What does end one is the usage footer. The gateway flushes it from
 * `flushReply`, which runs when the prompt resolves, and its own comment calls
 * it "the last usage snapshot of the turn" — one per turn, at the end,
 * including a turn that ended because somebody pressed stop.
 *
 * It is only sent when the agent reported any usage at all, so an agent that
 * reports none would leave the composer locked for good. For that case, and
 * only that case, a plain reply is taken as the end of a turn: worse, but the
 * old behaviour rather than a dead end. A task that has seen a usage footer has
 * an agent that publishes them, so its footers are the only marker used.
