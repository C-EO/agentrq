/**
 * Reaching the terminal of the agent working in this workspace.

 * the event stream and turns the header dot green — but a connection is not
 * something you can open. The terminal page is addressed by a session id, and
 * that is the one thing the page does not have.
 *
 * So this asks for it, and the asking is deliberately one request: the same
 * answer could be assembled from the machines list plus a session list per
 * machine, but that is one request per machine somebody owns to find at most
 * one row, on the page they sit on all day.

/**
 * Whether a session is one this workspace should offer a terminal for.
 *
 * Any session with an id — and the absence of a kind check is the decision,
 * not an omission.
 *
 * This listed `claude-code` alone until somebody hit the case it misses. The
 * argument for excluding the gateway was that it is already driveable from the
 * page: its turns arrive in the task composer, with a Stop button, because it
 * speaks ACP a turn at a time. That is true of the gateway's *turns* and of
 * nothing else. The gateway is also a process in a pseudo-terminal, and a
 * process asks its own questions on the way up — install this version (y/n),
 * trust this folder, paste a key. None of those are ACP, none of them reach
 * the composer, and until one is answered the agent is stopped. Excluding a
 * kind here excluded the only place those questions can be seen or answered.
 *
 * So the rule is the session, not the kind, which also means the next kind the
 * daemon learns to run is watchable because it is a terminal rather than
 * because somebody remembered a list.
 *
 * Exported and pure so the rule can be tested on its own. The id is what is
 * really being asked for: a row with none is what a backend answering `{}`
 * instead of `null` looks like by the time it reaches here, and offering a
 * button to `/sessions/undefined` is worse than offering nothing.
