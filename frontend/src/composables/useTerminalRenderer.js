/**
 * Which of xterm's renderers draws the terminal, and what happens when it dies.
 *
 * ## Why a renderer addon at all
 *
 * Without one xterm uses its **DOM renderer**, which asks the *font* for box
 * drawing and block elements. The WebGL renderer draws those glyphs itself
 * (xterm's `customGlyphs`, which its own typings note "doesn't work with the
 * DOM renderer"), so they join up regardless of what the font has — and the
 * shipped font's subset has no box drawing at all. An agent's framed interface
 * is most of what arrives here, so this is not a polish change.
 *
 * ## Why it is a list rather than an addon
 *
 * **WebGL is not always there.** Some Linux boxes, most VMs, a Chromium started
 * without a GPU, and the Electron build on a machine with a blocked driver all
 * fail it — and they fail it *late*, inside `activate()`, not in the
 * constructor, so `new WebglAddon()` succeeding proves nothing. Each candidate
 * is therefore tried by loading it, and a throw moves to the next one. The last
 * rung is no addon at all, which is the DOM renderer: a terminal that renders
 * imperfectly beats one that renders nothing.
 *
 * Today the caller passes one candidate. The list is here because the fallback
 * *chain* is the thing being tested, and because `@xterm/addon-canvas` is the
 * obvious next rung the day its release catches up with the engine — see the
 * note where the candidates are built.
 *
 * ## Context loss is not an error, it is an event
 *
 * A GPU can take its context away at any time — a driver reset, a laptop
 * switching cards, too many live contexts in other tabs. The addon says so
 * through `onContextLoss` and then **draws nothing ever again**: the terminal
 * goes blank and stays blank, which looks exactly like an agent that stopped
 * talking. So the addon is disposed and rebuilt when it fires.
 *
 * Rebuilding is bounded. A machine whose context is lost the moment it is
 * granted would otherwise rebuild forever, burning a GPU context each time, and
 * the thing it is fighting for is a renderer it evidently cannot keep. After
 * `recreations` attempts it drops to the next candidate and stays there.

 * driver reset that everybody actually hits.
