 * Desktop stand-in for `virtual:pwa-register/vue`.
 *
 * App.vue already has the right piece of UI for "a new version is available":
 * the banner it shows when a service worker is waiting, with an "Update now"
 * button and a dismiss. The desktop app has no service worker, but it has the
 * same thing to say — so rather than build a second banner that looks almost
 * the same, this presents the Electron updater through the interface App.vue
 * already consumes.
 *
 * The result is that the desktop update prompt is, by construction, pixel
 * identical to the web one, and App.vue needs no knowledge of either.
 *
 * The shape must match what App.vue destructures: a writable `needRefresh` ref
 * and an awaitable `updateServiceWorker`. `progress` is the one addition, and
 * App.vue treats it as optional since the web build has none.
 *
 * With no bridge present — the frontend's own test run, say — everything stays
 * inert, exactly as the plain stub does.
