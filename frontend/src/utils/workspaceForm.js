**Self-learning loop**
- Look back over the task for what a future task would be better off knowing, and save it to this workspace's memory or skills:
  - A correction from the human (style, format, workflow, "stop doing X"): record the preference, so the next task starts already knowing it.
  - Something you struggled with and solved, or a more efficient way you found to do it.
  - A memory or skill you relied on that turned out wrong, incomplete or outdated: fix it now.
- Update the memory or skill that already covers the topic rather than adding a near-duplicate, and rewrite any older note the new lesson contradicts.
- Write the rule, not the story: a line or two, linked from the memory index. If nothing was learned, save nothing.`;

- Before marking a task completed, summarise what you changed and why.`;
